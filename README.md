# Railway Track Maintenance Predictor

This project is a Streamlit web application that predicts the risk of failure for railway track segments using a machine learning model trained on track condition features such as temperature, vibration levels, geometry deviations, and more.

##  Project Overview

Railway infrastructure requires timely and efficient maintenance to prevent accidents and ensure safety. This application leverages a trained ML model to:
- Predict the probability of failure for a given track segment
- Suggest maintenance urgency based on risk thresholds
- Help railway engineers make data-driven maintenance decisions

##  Features

- Input-based interface to enter track parameters
- Real-time prediction using a pre-trained `.pkl` model
- Risk classification (High, Medium, Low, or Safe)
- Interactive UI built with Streamlit
